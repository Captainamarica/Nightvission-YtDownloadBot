# Limitations of my bot

I don't have unlimited servers and bandwidth, so I have to make some restrictions.

* 10 GiB one-way traffic per 24 hours for each user
* maximum 5 minutes streaming conversion support
* maximum 3 subscriptions

You can choose to become 'VIP' if you really need large traffic. And also, you could always deploy your own bot.
